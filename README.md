# Rubocop Roostify

As we have a variety of projects, It may be nice to have them conform to the same style guide without copy-pasting the same gosh-darn 8 lines of yml all over the place.

Instead, use the following as your starting ``.rubocop.yml`:

```
inherit_gem:
  rubocop_roostify: .rubocop.yml
```
